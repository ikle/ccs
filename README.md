# Coding Character Set Library

This library is designed to work with coded character sets and parsing
escape and control sequences as defined by ECMA-35, ECMA-48 and related
standards (ISO 2022, ISO 2375). A general description of the functionality,
the program application interface, and file formats used are given in
[the high-level design document](HLD.md).
